Homepage: `index.html` (report hub). Each report is a single self-contained HTML file. The only
external request is the Inter webfont from Google Fonts. There is no build step and
there are no dependencies.

## Deploying on Vercel

`vercel.json` serves the repo root as a static site (`framework: null`,
`outputDirectory: "."`, `cleanUrls: true`), so `/reports/<name>` works without the
`.html` extension. The Vercel project is connected to this repo: every push to `main`
publishes to production, and every other branch or PR gets its own preview URL.

Search engines are blocked with an `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header and `robots.txt`
because these are client reports.

## Adding another report

Put the new HTML file in `reports/` with a lowercase, hyphenated name, add a link
to it from `index.html`, then commit and push.

## Previewing locally

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```
